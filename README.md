### Overview:
The **Simple Calculator** is a basic Java application designed to perform elementary arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This user-friendly program takes two numbers as input and allows the user to select an operation, displaying the result in a clear and concise manner.

### Project Name: **Simple Calculator**

### Objective:
To develop a basic yet effective Java-based calculator that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and provides accurate and immediate results.

### Key Activities:
- **User Input**: The program prompts the user to input two numbers and select the desired arithmetic operation.
- **Operation Execution**: The calculator performs the chosen operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on the provided numbers.
- **Result Display**: After performing the operation, the result is displayed to the user in a clear format.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes error handling, especially for cases such as division by zero or invalid input formats (non-numeric values).
- **Modular Structure**: The calculator logic is divided into functions for each operation, making the code easy to maintain and extend.

### Key Insights:
- **Simplicity**: The project emphasizes simplicity in both the user interface and the underlying code, providing a smooth experience for basic arithmetic tasks.
- **Data Validation**: Proper validation ensures that only valid inputs (numeric values) are accepted, and the program handles errors gracefully, such as preventing division by zero.
- **Modular Approach**: The programâ€™s modular design makes it easy to extend functionality. Additional features, such as more complex operations (e.g., exponentiation, square roots), could be added with minimal changes.
- **Reusability**: The core logic for arithmetic operations can be reused or integrated into more complex systems if needed.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java Programming Language**
